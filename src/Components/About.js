            <p>Hello, guys. My name is Jignesh Patel. I'm an IT engineer. 
              I graduated from the GTU in 2022. I describe myself as a passionate 
              developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform. Build 
              web applications with web development best practices. Transform app 
              designs into front-end code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Work with 
              back-end developers to integrate UI components with APIs and databases.
              I love combining the worlds of logic and creative desing to make eye-catching,
              accessible, and user-friendly websites. I'm excited to make the leap and continue
              refining my skill with the right company.
